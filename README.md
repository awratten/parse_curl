# Curl-to-Requests-Code Converter

This Python script converts a `curl` command into equivalent headers and data for use with the `requests` library.

## Description

The `curl-to-requests` script allows you to convert a `curl` command, along with its headers and data, into Python code that uses the `requests` library to make the same HTTP request. This can be helpful when you want to replicate a `curl` request in your Python code.

## Features

- Converts `curl` command into Python code using the `requests` library.
- Handles headers and data from the `curl` command.
- No external libraries or dependencies required apart from the `requests` library.

## Usage

1. Copy the desired `curl` command to be converted.
2. Run the Python script to get the equivalent headers and data.
3. Use the generated headers and data with the `requests` library in your Python code.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the `requests` library by running:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Replace the `curl_string` variable in the script with your desired `curl` command.
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python curl_to_requests.py
   ```

## Example

```python
import requests

# Copy and paste your curl command here
curl_string = """
# ... (your curl command here) ...
"""

# Rest of the script to convert and use the headers and data

```

## Limitations

- Assumes the `curl` string is well-formatted and doesn't handle all edge cases.
- Doesn't cover all possible options that `curl` supports.
